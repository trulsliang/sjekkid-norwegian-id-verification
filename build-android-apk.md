# Building Android APK for SJEKK ID

## Current Status
✅ Capacitor Android project has been successfully created
✅ Web assets have been built and copied to Android project
✅ Project is ready for APK compilation
❌ Cannot build APK on Replit (Android SDK required)
ℹ️ Use one of the methods below to build the APK

## Building Options

### Option 1: Build on Local Machine with Android Studio (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
1. **Download and install Android Studio**: https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Install JDK 17 or higher**
3. **Configure Android SDK through Android Studio**

#### Steps
1. **Clone/Download this project** to your local machine
2. **Open Android Studio**
3. **Open the `android` folder as an Android project**
4. **Wait for Gradle sync** to complete
5. **Build APK**:
   - Go to `Build` → `Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)` → `Build APK(s)`
   - APK will be generated in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

### Option 2: Build via Command Line (After Android SDK setup)

```bash
# Navigate to android directory
cd android

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK (requires signing)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions (Automated Build)

I can set up GitHub Actions to automatically build the APK when you push changes:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build-android.yml
name: Build Android APK

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
        
    - name: Setup Android SDK
      uses: android-actions/setup-android@v2
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
    - name: Build web assets
      run: npm run build
      
    - name: Copy to Android
      run: npx cap copy android
      
    - name: Build APK
      run: |
        cd android
        ./gradlew assembleDebug
        
    - name: Upload APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: app-debug
        path: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Project Structure Created

## Configuration Files Created

### capacitor.config.ts
- App ID: `no.tl.sjekkid`
- App Name: `SJEKK ID`
- Camera permissions configured
- HTTPS scheme for Android

### Key Features Enabled
- ✅ Camera access for QR scanning
- ✅ Web app assets bundled
- ✅ HTTPS support
- ✅ Norwegian ID verification functionality
- ✅ Offline PWA features

## APK Signing (For Release)

For production APK, you'll need to:

1. **Generate signing key**:
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

2. **Configure signing** in `android/app/build.gradle`

3. **Build signed APK**:
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Installation on Android Devices

Once you have the APK file:

1. **Enable "Unknown Sources"** in Android Settings → Security
2. **Transfer APK** to Android device
3. **Install APK** by tapping on it
4. **Grant camera permissions** when prompted

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **"SDK location not found"**: Install Android Studio and SDK
- **Java version errors**: Use JDK 17 or compatible version
- **Gradle build failures**: Check Android SDK tools are installed
- **Camera not working**: Ensure app has camera permissions

### Development Notes:
- Debug APK is not optimized and larger in size
- Release APK requires signing for production use
- Test on multiple Android versions for compatibility

## File Locations After Build

- **Debug APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- **Release APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## Next Steps

1. Choose one of the build options above
2. Build the APK file
3. Test installation on Android device
4. Verify all functionality works (camera, scanning, authentication)
5. Consider publishing to Google Play Store if desired

Your SJEKK ID app is now ready to be compiled into an Android APK! The web application has been successfully packaged using Capacitor, maintaining all the Norwegian ID verification functionality while providing a native Android app experience.
