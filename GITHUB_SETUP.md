# GitHub Setup for SJEKK ID - Alternative Method

Since git operations are restricted in Replit, here's how to get your project on GitHub for APK building:

## Option 1: Download and Upload Method (Easiest)

### Step 1: Download Your Project
1. In Replit, click the three dots menu (⋯) next to your files
2. Select "Download as ZIP"
3. Extract the ZIP file on your computer

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com and sign in
2. Click "+" → "New repository"
3. Name: `sjekkid-norwegian-id-verification`
4. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Actions)
5. Check "Add a README file"
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Upload Files
1. In your new GitHub repository, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop all files from your extracted project
3. **Important**: Make sure these key files are included:
   - `.github/workflows/build-android.yml` (for APK building)
   - `android/` folder (complete Android project)
   - `capacitor.config.ts` (Capacitor configuration)
   - All source code files

### Step 4: Commit
1. Write commit message: "Initial commit: SJEKK ID Norwegian identity verification platform"
2. Click "Commit changes"

## Option 2: GitHub CLI/Desktop (Advanced)

If you have GitHub Desktop or git installed locally:
1. Clone your new GitHub repository
2. Copy all files from your downloaded Replit project
3. Commit and push

## After Upload: Automatic APK Building

Once your files are on GitHub:

### 1. Trigger Build
1. Go to your repository → "Actions" tab
2. You should see "Build Android APK" workflow
3. If it doesn't run automatically, click "Run workflow"

### 2. Download APK
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for build to complete
2. Click on the completed workflow run
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
4. Download "sjekkid-debug-apk"
5. Extract to get your `app-debug.apk` file

## Key Files for APK Building

Make sure these are uploaded to GitHub:

### Essential Files:
- `.github/workflows/build-android.yml` - Builds APK automatically
- `android/` - Complete Android project folder
- `capacitor.config.ts` - App configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration

### Source Code:
- `client/` - React frontend
- `server/` - Express backend  
- `shared/` - Shared schemas

## Expected Result

After successful upload and build:
- ✅ GitHub repository with complete project
- ✅ Automatic APK building via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Downloadable APK file ready for Android installation
- ✅ All Norwegian ID verification features preserved

## Troubleshooting

### If APK build fails:
1. Check Actions tab for error details
2. Ensure all files uploaded correctly
3. Verify `android/` folder is complete

### If download link doesn't work:
1. Make repository public
2. Re-run the workflow
3. Check artifacts section after completion

Your SJEKK ID project is completely ready - it just needs to get to GitHub for the automated APK building to work!
